# Document-Recognition
Cross-platform app, which uses OpenCV's OCR for acquiring data from official documents

Please, read the following:

1.Based on your PC's operating system, change sdk.dir value in "local.properties" file.

	OSX	sdk.dir = /Users/dev/Library/Android/sdk
	Linux	sdk.dir = /home/USERNAME/Android/Sdk
	Windows sdk.dir = C\:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk

2.In my case, I can modify the App.js file and see the changes only when using my Android smartphone for testing. In case of AVD, it just gets stuck at the first version no matter what code is contained in App.js file.
